# 🧠 Data Mining Project - Association Rule Mining for Heart Disease

This repository contains data mining tasks and analysis focused on discovering patterns and insights using **Association Rule Mining**, particularly applied to a heart disease dataset.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses **Apriori algorithm** and **association rule mining** techniques to extract the top 10 contributing factors for heart disease based on patient data. The project includes:

- Data preprocessing
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Frequent itemset generation using `mlxtend`
- Extraction of strong association rules based on lift and confidence
- Visualization of rules and insights
